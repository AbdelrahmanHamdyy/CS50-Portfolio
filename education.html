        <h2 style="margin-top:-30px" class="title">Elementary School</h2>
        <div class="edu">
            <p>From Grades 1 to 4, I went to Al-Afkar International School then transitioned into Jeddah International school in Grade 5. I
            only spent 1 year there because the teaching system was weak and ineffective so I had to switch schools once again. Grade 6, I applied
            for Global International school and the rest is history. American cirriculum was the one taught in elementary school and that was by default
            meaning I had no other choice but I wasnt complaining.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="title">Middle School</h2>
        <div style="height:365px" class="edu">
            <p>Grades 7-9 were in Global International School as well. It was basically one of the top schools in Jeddah with experienced
            and hardworking staff. I made various friendships there as well which was the best part of this whole journey, as in they were the main motivation
            for waking up everyday on 8 AM and going to school. However, grades 7 and 8 were also part of the American Cirriculum but Grade 9 onwards,
            thats when they gave us the choice to choose either SAT or IGCSE. I chose the british cirriculum mainly because I heard that it was tougher and
            would qualify me perfectly for university plus it was the most wanted system in Egypt, the country which i wanted to study at after highschool.
            Its safe to say that 9th grade was the toughest year to go through and the reason was the massive difference between the American cirriculum
            which I was used to my entire life and then a completely new system which was the British system. It took me a whole term to cope with it.
            Yes there were multiple fails and depression periods but I didnt give up and knew that I was up for the challenge.</p>

        <h2 class="title">High School</h2>
        <div style="height:420px;" class="edu">
            <p>Grade 10 was the real challenge! My fist official IGCSE exam session was May/June 2017 and thankfully I aced it after
            tons of hardwork, dedication, courage and vision by scoring 5 A*s and 1 B. The following session was Oct/Nov and I didnt do well or atleast didnt
            get the grades I wanted. I guess you can say it was because I got tired and lazy/arrogant after doing so unexpectedly well in the previous
            session. Then it was Grade 11 ( AS LEVEL ) where I took Math and Physics in addition to business as a repitition from Nov17.
            I got back on the right track and gave it all in which made me score the highest grade in all subjects but then I didnt let the same
            scenario happen as in the previous Oct/Nov so I pushed myself to the limit in Oct/Nov 18, didnt get lazy and had my mindset
            fixed on scoring 2 A*s in the last subjects of my O-LEVELS which is exactly what happened &#128170! Finally, My father and I realised
            that I gained minimal benefits from Global and on top of that was paying high prices for the fees so we decided to end my educational
            journey in another school which was Al-Waha International School. Yeah I wanted to stay with my old friends but we had no other
            choice.So for the last M/J session I only had one subject (Math AL) therefore I had plenty of time to make sure that I score an A*
            in it and be able to apply to the university Ive been dreaming to enroll in since the start of this trip.</p>

            <p>First time studying in Egypt was when I applied for Cairo University - Faculty of Engineering and got accepted, this is where I study now (2020)!
            However, before choosing what engineering major we want to pursue, we had to go through a prep year which ensures that all students have the
            exact same knowledge of engineering subjects such as math, physics,drawing and so on...The first term of this general year was tough by all means.
            Lectures gradually got harder each week and more content was being absorbed by us in which we had to understand and study carefully. Midterm and final
            exams were challenging but I managed to successfully ace them, therefore ended the term with excellent grades. Second term was obviously the pandemic
            and we had to get used to Online Learning that included online exams,quizzes,projects and assignments. This was way easier than if we had to go through
            the term normally like the first one so I passed it with excellence as well!</p>

        <div>
        <p id="conc">And here we are! I ended up choosing Computer Engineering which ill be starting it next year as Im convinced that its
        the most suitable major for me and my career. Super excited for what the future beholds!</p>
